home.title=Welcome on ConfOCARA
home=Home
home.description=ConfOCARA is a web site which allows accessibility and safety experts to configure questionnaires, that deal with the accessibility of rooms and living spaces. These questionnaires are called chapter and they can be regrouped into rulesets, which can be divided into 6 categories such as accessibility and safety. 
home.rulesetDef=The rulesets are downloadable from the audit application named OCARA.
home.illustrationDef=A ruleset links auditable objets (such as doors, corridors, stairs and switches) with chapters, through control rules. Some explanations may explain the rules. Determining the compliance of an object against the rules helps on evaluating a score grid.
home.fundamentals.title=A ruleset is a group of objects
home.fundamentals=All the created material (objects, explanations, rules...) can be used to create and extend the rulesets. The expert community should agree on the rules applied to a given object type, to form sets of relevant rules, complete and widely shared.
home.structure.title=The structure of referentials
home.distribution=ConfOCARA and OCARA are open-source.
home.distribution2=These applications are developed by Orange and contributed by the OW2 - OSAi (Open Source Accessibility initiative)

home.principle.title=Principle
home.principle.content.confocara.begin=<span class="text-primary">Experts (accessibility or safety)</span> can write and maintain accessibility rules

home.principle.content.ocara.begin=<span class="text-primary">Auditors</span> choose some of these rules</span>
home.principle.content.ocara.end=in OCARA.
home.principle.content.target=Goal = Evaluation rules more relevant and exhaustive thanks to a community of experts.

home.howto.title=Make available to the auditors
home.howto.content=How to deal with new elements (such as <span class="co-text-info">referentials</span>, <span class="co-text-info">chapters</span>, <span class="co-text-info">sub-chapters</span>, <span class="co-text-info">groups of rules</span>, <span class="co-text-info">rules</span> or <span class="co-text-info">explanations</span>) and make them available for auditors (in OCARA) ?
home.example.title=Here is an example from scratch : basically, you'll have to follow the order of the left menu from bottom to top :
home.example.1=Add an <span class="co-text-info">object</span>.
home.example.2=Optional : add an <span class="text-primary">explanation</span>.
home.example.3=Add a <span class="text-primary">rule</span> ; eventually, <span class="text-primary">add</span> an explanation to it.
home.example.4=Add a <span class="text-primary">group of rules</span> ; and <span class="text-primary">add</span> the rule to it.
home.example.5=Add a <span class="text-primary">sub-chapter</span> ; and <span class="text-primary">add</span> the group of rules to it.
home.example.6=Add a <span class="text-primary">chapter</span> ; and <span class="text-primary">link</span> it to both the <span class="co-text-info">object</span> and the <span class="co-text-info">sub-chapter</span>.
home.example.6bis=Check the content of the chapter, and then <span class="text-primary">make it ready</span> (for OCARA).
home.example.7=Add a <span class="text-primary">group of chapters</span> ; add <span class="text-primary">add</span> the chapter to it.
