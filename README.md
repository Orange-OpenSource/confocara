# ConfOCARA  
ConfOCARA is a web application for accessibility experts who create and publish the audit referentials to be downloaded from OCARA application. They are mainly set of rules about accessibility, but we can also manage other types of self-diagnosis like safety.  
ConfOCARA is closely related to OCARA, together they constitute the OCARA solution.  
OCARA, available for 10 inch Android tablet, is an application designed for performing a self-diagnosis of buildings accessibility. More broadly, it makes it possible to carry out an audit type based on the downloaded audit referentials.  

# For who ?
ConfOCARA users are specialists in accessibility, security…  or the service designers who support them. They publish open contents, they must be declared by the administrator of the application.  

# Employees Benefits

- Be able to regularly update and enrich audit referentials without having to redeploy versions of the OCARA application

# Business Benefits

Orange decided to open-source the whole Ocara solution so that all companies, associations and individuals concerned about accessibility, can use this tool and contribute to its development.  
Accessibility is a common concern. It is by pooling and sharing our accessibility resources we will go further together. watch the [video](http://vod.com.ftgroup/content/encoded/t81HxrJyewTuNLcLgfph.asx)
