# OCARA [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Orange-OpenSource/ocara.svg?branch=internationalisation)](https://travis-ci.org/Orange-OpenSource/ocara)

OCARA, available for 10 inch Android tablet, is primarily an application for performing a self-diagnosis of buildings accessibility. You can use expert, but you do not need to be an expert!
Typically, you describe and audit the path from a given starting point to a destination in the building (for instance from the entrance to a specific meeting room).
Each object you encounter is referenced up the path as you go. Objects are, for example, a path, a door, a gate, a sidewalk...
 
Associated with scalable and customizable set of rules, it allows to audit any type of object or service area, according to a multi-disability approach.

**Orange** decided to open-source Ocara so that all companies, associations and individuals concerned about accessibility, can use this tool and contribute to its development.

Accessibility is a common concern. It is by pooling and sharing our accessibility resources we will go further together.
